This is for when server is set up to serve URLS to mirrors instead of .dbz
files directly.  This also allows multi-step incremental updates (instead
of serving _full files to clients that have missed an update).

The URLS tag indicates that the response contains URL batches.
The batches are delimited by #
Each batch has an "UPDATE A->B size" header, indicating that this update is 
incremental from version A to version B and has a given download size, followed
by one URL mirror of that update per line.




Valid platform codes are currently "mac", "win", and "linux"
